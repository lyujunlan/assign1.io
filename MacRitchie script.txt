1. Tree Top Walk 

If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the tranquility of walking above lush green foliage, you’ll get your chance at the Treetop Walk. Suspended 25M above the forest floor, the iconic bridge has a spectacular 360° view of the lush greenery around, with the neighbouring Lower-Pierce Reservoir in the distance. The best part? There are no high-rise buildings in sight. 


2. Explore the reservoir on a kayak

From the entrance, the first sight that you’re likely to catch is people kayaking away in the tranquil waters. Most might enter the area to hike but for a change of scenery, you can also rent a kayak from Paddle Lodge to explore the reservoir park from the waters.

Kayaking is friendly to first-timer, both single and double sit-on-top kayaks are available for rent.

3. Go freshwater fishing

MacRitchie is one of the few public places in Singapore you can fish at – at least legally. Since it’s a freshwater body, there’s no need to worry about getting sandy or sticky, as you would while fishing by the sea.




4. Animals - Monkeys, turtles and monitor lizard!

There’re plenty of interesting plants and wildlife along this route, so make sure to keep your eyes peele :)
